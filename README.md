# Dotfiles
Just my dotfiles, unlikely to be usefull to anyone

## Installation
To "install" the dotfiles simply make link.sh executable and run it. This will make symbolic links between the scripts in the cloned repo and the user's home dir. It will NOT overwrite any scripts and any failiures will be obvious.
